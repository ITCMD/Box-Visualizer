# Box-Visualizer
Create Box-menus using unicode for your batch file. (Results are 100% compatible)
Program runs on windows 10+
Code output will run on Windows 7 and 10 on any machine.
# How it Works
- You can create as many **Sessions** as you want. Each session is a seperate project
- When you create or resume a session, it opens a text document. In the document is the palette. It contains all the special characters you can use. The palette takes up 12 lines, and will be ignored by the program (do not remove it from your document or 12 other lines will be ignored).
- When you modify anything in the document (and save it) it will appear on the command prompt window, showing you how it would look.
- Once you are done you can open the menu (by going to the command prompt window and pressing M) and choose "Export".
- This will create a batch script you can put inside your batch program, which will display whatever you created. It will not change how your script runs and you do not have to change encoding. <br> <br>

This script uses the In2Batch batch script: https://github.com/ITCMD/In2Batch
as well as extracts from the CMDS script: https://github.com/ITCMD/CMDS

The Bget version does not use any 3rd party EXEs but the output script is slower.
